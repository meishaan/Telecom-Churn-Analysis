Telecom Churn Analysis â€“ Iranian Telecom Dataset

Overview

This project analyzes customer churn in an Iranian telecom company using Python for data cleaning, SQL for exploratory data analysis (EDA), and Tableau (ongoing) for visualization. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to churn and derive actionable insights.
